Description: EC2 ECS cluster that starts out empty, with no EC2 instances yet.
             An ECS capacity provider automatically launches more EC2 instances
             as required on the fly when you request ECS to launch services or
             standalone tasks.
Parameters:
  InstanceType:
    Description: EC2 instance type
    Type: String
    Default: c5.xlarge
    Description: Class of EC2 instance used to host containers. Choose t2 for testing, m5 for general purpose, c5 for CPU intensive services, and r5 for memory intensive services
    AllowedValues: [ t2.micro, t2.small, t2.medium, t2.large, t2.xlarge, t2.2xlarge,
     m5.large, m5.xlarge, m5.2large, m5.4xlarge, m5.12xlarge, m5.24large,
     c5.large, c5.xlarge, c5.2xlarge, c5.4xlarge, c5.9xlarge, c5.18xlarge,
     r5.large, r5.xlarge, r5.2xlarge, r5.4xlarge, r5.12xlarge, r5.24xlarge ]
    ConstraintDescription: Please choose a valid instance type.
