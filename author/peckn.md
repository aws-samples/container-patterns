### Hi I'm Nathan! 👋

I work as a senior developer advocate at AWS 🥑

You can [chat with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankpeck), or [check my blog](https://nathanpeck.com) for interesting articles and videos

Here are some of my favorite open source sample applications I'm proud of:
  - A [serverless chat application](https://github.com/nathanpeck/socket.io-chat-fargate) built using AWS Fargate, and DynamoDB
  - A [serverless changelog crawler and search engine](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-changelogs-demo), which powers my website [changelogs.md](https://changelogs.md)

I am also responsible for:
  - [Awesome ECS](https://github.com/nathanpeck/awesome-ecs/blob/master/README.md): A curated list that helps folks who want to dive into the world of deploying containerized applications using Amazon ECS.
  - [ecs-service-extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-cdk-containers/ecs-service-extensions): An AWS Cloud Development Kit module for constructing ECS services and extending them with features like service mesh and observability
