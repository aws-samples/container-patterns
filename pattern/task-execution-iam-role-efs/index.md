The following CloudFormation example shows how to write a task execution role for Amazon Elastic File System (ECS) which allows ECS to mount an Elastic File System to a task.

```yaml
# Base task execution role
TaskExecutionRole:
  Type: AWS::IAM::Role
  Properties:
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
      Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
          Principal:
            Service: [ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com]
          Action: ['sts:AssumeRole']
          Condition:
            ArnLike:
              aws:SourceArn: !Sub arn:aws:ecs:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:*
            StringEquals:
              aws:SourceAccount: !Ref AWS::AccountId
    ManagedPolicyArns:
      - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

# Grant additional ability to access Elastic File System
TaskAccessToEFS:
  Type: AWS::IAM::Policy
  Properties:
    Roles:
      - !Ref TaskExecutionRole
    PolicyName: AccessSecret
    PolicyDocument:
      Version: '2012-10-17'
      Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
          Action:
            - elasticfilesystem:ClientMount
            - elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite
            - elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargets
            - elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems
          Resource: !GetAtt EFSFileSystem.Arn
```

This role starts out based on the default `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` managed policy provided by
AWS. The base managed role has minimal permissions that allow launching a task and collecting logs, but nothing else.

By attaching additional `elasticfilesystem:*` actions, you can enable the ECS agent to locate and mount an Elastic File System as part of task startup.
