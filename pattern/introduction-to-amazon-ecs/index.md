Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the rest of the AWS platform to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and now on your infrastructure with Amazon ECS Anywhere.

Amazon ECS leverages serverless technology from AWS Fargate to deliver autonomous container operations, which reduces the time spent on configuration, patching, and security. Instead of worrying about managing the control plane, add-ons, and nodes, Amazon ECS enables you to rapidly build applications and grow your business.
