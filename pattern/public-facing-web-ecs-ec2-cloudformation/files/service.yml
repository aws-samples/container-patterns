Description: An example service that deploys a bridge networking mode
             on EC2 capacity. Service uses a capacity provider to request
             EC2 instances to run on.

Parameters:
  VpcId:
    Type: String
    Description: The VPC that the service is running inside of
  SubnetIds:
    Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>
    Description: List of public subnet ID's the load balancer is hosted in.
  ClusterName:
    Type: String
    Description: The name of the ECS cluster into which to launch capacity.
  ECSTaskExecutionRole:
    Type: String
    Description: The role used to start up an ECS task
  CapacityProvider:
    Type: String
    Description: The cluster capacity provider that the service should use
                 to request capacity when it wants to start up a task
  ServiceName:
    Type: String
    Default: web
    Description: A name for the service
  ImageUrl:
    Type: String
    Default: public.ecr.aws/docker/library/nginx:latest
    Description: The url of a docker image that contains the application process that
                 will handle the traffic for this service
  ContainerCpu:
    Type: Number
    Default: 256
    Description: How much CPU to give the container. 1024 is 1 CPU
  ContainerMemory:
    Type: Number
    Default: 512
    Description: How much memory in megabytes to give the container
  ContainerPort:
    Type: Number
    Default: 80
    Description: What port that the application expects traffic on
  DesiredCount:
    Type: Number
    Default: 2
    Description: How many copies of the service task to run
  ContainerHostSecurityGroup:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the security group that is used by the EC2 instances.
                 Used so that the service can add its load balancer's security
                 group as an authorized source of inbound traffic.
