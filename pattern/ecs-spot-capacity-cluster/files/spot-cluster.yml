  # Custom resource that force destroys the ASG. This cleans up EC2 instances that had
  # managed termination protection enabled, but which are not yet released.
  # This is necessary because ECS does not immediately release an EC2 instance from termination
  # protection as soon as the instance is no longer running tasks. There is a cooldown delay.
  # In the case of tearing down the CloudFormation stack, CloudFormation will delete the
  # AWS::ECS::Service and immediately move on to tearing down the AWS::ECS::Cluster, disconnecting
  # the AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup from ECS management too fast, before ECS has a chance
  # to asynchronously turn off managed instance protection on the EC2 instances.
  # This will leave some EC2 instances stranded in a state where they are protected from scale-in forever.
  # This then blocks the AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup from cleaning itself up.
  # The custom resource function force destroys the autoscaling group when tearing down the stack,
  # avoiding the issue of protected EC2 instances that can never be cleaned up.
