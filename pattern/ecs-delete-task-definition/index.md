#### Installation

Download the script below and use `chmod` to make it executable:

```sh
chmod +x delete-tasks.sh
```

#### Script

<<< files/delete-tasks.sh

#### Usage

Modify the following variables to use the script:

- `TASKNAME` - The task definition family to delete from. Use `aws ecs list-task-definitions` to list task definitions if you are unsure.
- `START` - The revision number to start deleting from
- `END` - The revision number to stop deleting at

Note that task definitions are 1 based, not zero based, so to delete the first 1000 task definition revisions set START=1 and END=1000

::: info
Deleting task definitions may take a while. The task definitions will not be instantly deleted. Instead they will transition to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state and ECS will gradually clean up these task definitions in the background when they are no longer in use by any ECS services or running tasks.
