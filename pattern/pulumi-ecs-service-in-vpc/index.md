Pulumi is an infrastructure as code framework for software engineers. Instead of writing YAML to define your infrastructure you can use higher level SDK commands, in a familiar programming language, and Pulumi will create the necessary resources for you automatically.

### Setup

1. Ensure that you have [Pulumi setup on your system and configured to connect to AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/begin/).
2. [Start a new Pulumi project](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/create-project/)
3. Copy the code above into your Pulumi project

### Usage

Show a preview of resources to be deployed:

```sh
pulumi preview
```

Deploy the resources to your AWS account:

```sh
pulumi up
```

Print out the URL of the deployed ECS service's load balancer:

```sh
pulumi stack output url
```

Tear down the stack and all of its resources:

```sh
pulumi destroy
```
